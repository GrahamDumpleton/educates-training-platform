# Contributing to Educates

We welcome contributions from the community and first want to thank you for taking the time to contribute.

Before diving in and trying to make changes to Educates, be aware that the design of the Educates platform is intended to enable many tasks which are not already supported by utilitizing existing capabilities available from a workshop definition in conjunction with distinct custom Kubernetes operators, thereby avoiding the need to add new functionality to the core Educates platform.

If your intention was to make changes that go beyond a simple typo correction or obvious bug fix, we strongly encourage you to initiate a discussion with us first by raising an issue on GitHub. This enables us to assess proposed changes and evaluate whether a change to the core platform is really needed, or if there's a more effective approach to achieve the desired outcome without making the changes. Our primary goal is to see you leverage Educates and be productive using it, without stumbling on working out how to achieve it.

For what could be very minor changes, we acknowledge that it might be more efficient for us to implement the changes, so again feel free to raise a GitHub issue and there's no pressure to create a pull request.

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

* Make a fork of the repository within your GitHub account
* Create a topic branch in your fork from where you want to base your work
* Make commits of logical units
* Make sure your commit messages are with the proper format, quality and descriptiveness (see below)
* Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork
* Create a pull request containing that commit

We follow the GitHub workflow and you can find more details on the [GitHub flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

Before submitting your pull request, we advise you to use the following:

### Pull Request Checklist
