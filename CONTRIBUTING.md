# Contributing to Educates

We welcome contributions from the community and first want to thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Please be aware that the design of the Educates platform allows for accomplishing many tasks without directly altering the core platform. Therefore, the guiding principle for this project is "discuss before code." If your intention is to contribute a pull request that goes beyond simple typo corrections or evident bug fixes, it's recommended to initiate a discussion by raising an issue. This preliminary step enables us to assess proposed modifications and ascertain whether they necessitate adjustments to the core platform or if there's a more effective approach to achieve the desired outcome without modifying it.

Even for seemingly minor alterations, we acknowledge that it might be more efficient for us to implement the changes. Feel free to articulate your objectives through an issue without any hesitation, and there's no pressure to create a pull request for the alteration. Our primary goal is to see you leverage Educates without unnecessary delays caused by configuration concerns.

## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

* Make a fork of the repository within your GitHub account
* Create a topic branch in your fork from where you want to base your work
* Make commits of logical units
* Make sure your commit messages are with the proper format, quality and descriptiveness (see below)
* Push your changes to the topic branch in your fork
* Create a pull request containing that commit

We follow the GitHub workflow and you can find more details on the [GitHub flow documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

Before submitting your pull request, we advise you to use the following:

### Pull Request Checklist

1. Check if your code changes will pass any code linting checks and unit tests which may be used by the project.
2. Ensure your commit messages are descriptive. We follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message. See [GFM syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues and commits.
3. Check the commits and commits messages and ensure they are free from typos.

## Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues
