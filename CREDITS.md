This project borrows heavily from a similar project by the same author (Graham Dumpleton) called [Homeroom](https://github.com/openshift-homeroom), which was developed while working for Red Hat. The current project is a refactoring of the prior work, with a primary focus on native Kubernetes clusters instead of OpenShift. This project and the original project are both made available under the terms of the Apache License, Version 2.0.
