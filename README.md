Tanzu Learning Center
---------------------

Note that the Learning Center platform integrated into the Tanzu Application Platform is a copy/fork of Educates made at the beginning of 2021. Work on Educates was suspended at that time, but to meet the needs of Tanzu Developer Center and KubeAcademy, development work on Educates was restarted at the beginning of 2022. The development of Educates and Learning Center now run independently.
