Documentation for Educates
==========================

The Educates project provides a system for hosting interactive workshop
environments in Kubernetes, or on top of a local container runtime. It can be
used for self paced or supervised workshops. It can also be useful where you
need to package up demos of applications hosted in Kubernetes or a local
container runtime.

This repository holds the documentation for deploying and using Educates,
including how to create your own workshop content.

A hosted version of this documentation can be found at:

The source code for Educates can be found in the separate repository at:
