Educates Training Platform
==========================

The Educates project provides a system for hosting interactive workshop
environments in Kubernetes. It can be used for self paced or supervised
workshops. It can also be useful where you need to package up demos of
applications hosted in Kubernetes for users or potential customers.

For detailed instructions on how to deploy and make use of Educates see the
[Educates documentation](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/educates-docs).
