Documentation for Educates
==========================

This repository holds the documentation for deploying and using Educates, including how to create your own workshop content.

This project has previously been known by the names "eduk8s" and "edukates". The official name for the project is now "Educates".

A hosted version of this documentation can be found at:

* https://educates-docs.netlify.app/index.html

Access to the hosted version of the documentation requires a password, which can be obtained from VMware's internal "educates-redux" Slack channel.

Tanzu Learning Center
---------------------

Note that the Learning Center platform integrated into the Tanzu Application Platform is a copy/fork of Educates taken at the beginning of 2021. Work on Educates was suspended at that time, but to meet the needs of Tanzu Developer Center and KubeAcademy, development work on Educates was restarted at the beginning of 2022. The development of Educates and Learning Center now run independently.
