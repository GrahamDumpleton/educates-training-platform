Documentation for educates
==========================

This repository holds the documentation for deploying and using educates, including how to create your own workshop content.

Note that this project has previously been known by the names "eduk8s" and "edukates". The official name for the project is now "educates". Usage of the old names is slowly being removed from the project code and documentation, and the project rehosted under a different GitHub organization name. When this is complete, you will need to migrate to the new naming and repositories for releases.
