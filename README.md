Educates Training Platform
==========================

The Educates project provides a system for hosting interactive workshop
environments in Kubernetes, or on top of a local container runtime. It can be
used for self paced or supervised workshops. It can also be useful where you
need to package up demos of applications hosted in Kubernetes or a local
container runtime.

For detailed instructions on how to deploy and make use of Educates see the
[Educates user documentation](https://docs.educates.dev/).
