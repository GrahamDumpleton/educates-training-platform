# Scenarios

There's some scenarios we want to cover and test. We can print the list of scenarios and the
test file by executing:

```
./test-scenarios.sh --help
```

We can run the scenarios by executing:

```
./test-scenarios.sh
```

If you want to see the processed config generated by each scenario:

```
./test-scenarios.sh --debug
```

If you want to see things `TODO` for an scenario:

```
./test-scenarios.sh --todo
```

**NOTE** Take into account that values are mock, so if you really want to test these scenarios into a cluster
make a copy and alter the values to your needs.

**NOTE** You will need to have a cluster to test on the cluster

## Scenarios implemented

To get a list of implemented scenarios and their description run:

```
./test-scenarios.sh -h
```
