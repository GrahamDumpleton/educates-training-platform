We are still building out a set of sample workshops, and developing an online hub for finding workshops (including third party workshops) which will work with eduk8s. Below are a selection of workshops you can try now.

* `Container Basics <https://github.com/eduk8s-labs/lab-container-basics>`_ An interactive workshop on running applications in containers.
* `Image Security <https://github.com/eduk8s-labs/lab-image-security>`_ An interactive workshop on constructing secure images.
* `Python Containers <https://github.com/eduk8s-labs/lab-python-containers>`_ An interactive workshop on building images for Python applications.
* `Octant Testing <https://github.com/eduk8s-labs/lab-octant-testing>`_ - An introduction to Octant and play area for testing it.

Also keep an eye on the GitHub organisation:
