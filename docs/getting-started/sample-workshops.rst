Sample Workshops
================

We are still building out a set of sample workshops, and developing an online hub for finding workshops (including third party workshops) which will work with eduk8s. Below are a selection of workshops you can try now.

* `Kubernetes Fundamentals <https://github.com/eduk8s-labs/lab-k8s-fundamentals>`_ - An interactive workshop on Kubernetes fundamentals.
* `Testing out Octant <https://github.com/eduk8s-labs/lab-octant-testing>`_ - An introduction to Octant and play area for testing it.

Also keep an eye on the GitHub organisation:

* https://github.com/eduk8s-labs

for more workshops from the eduk8s project as they are made available.

For starter templates for creating your own workshops, see:

* `Markdown Sample <https://github.com/eduk8s/lab-markdown-sample>`_ - Sample workshop content using Markdown formatting for pages.
* `AsciiDoc Sample <https://github.com/eduk8s/lab-asciidoc-sample>`_ - Sample workshop content using AsciiDoc formatting for pages.
