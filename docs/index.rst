eduk8s
======

The **eduk8s** project provides a system for hosting interactive workshop environments in Kubernetes. It can be used for self paced or supervised workshops where users need access to command line clients and other tools when working with Kubernetes, and you want to avoid needing to have users install anything on their own local computer.

Users are provided access to a dashboard combining workshop content and a shell environment via a terminal in their web browser. The dashboard can also embed the Kubernetes web console, slide content or custom web applications.
