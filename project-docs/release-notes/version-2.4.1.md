Version 2.4.1
=============

Features Changed
----------------

* When reporting data to Microsoft Clarity, the internal training portal user
  ID, or user ID supplied by a front end portal using the REST API, will be
  reported as the custom user ID field.

* The static file assets for the workshop dashboard and renderer for workshop
  instructions are now accessible without needing to be authenticated. This is
  to allow Microsoft Clarity to access stylesheets so that recordings and heat
  maps can better render captures of web site pages.
