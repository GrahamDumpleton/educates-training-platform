Version 2.6.7
=============

Bugs Fixed
----------

* If the `vi` editor or any other visual terminal application had been run from
  the terminal, and the application exited such that the prompt was back at the
  terminal, if a full browser refresh was done, then a series of terminal escape
  sequences would be left in the input buffer of the terminal. If return was
  then entered into the terminal the shell would try and execute the escape
  sequences which would fail. This was due to how past terminal output was
  replayed on terminal session reconnection to try and restore the terminal
  view. The escape sequences were generated by the terminal front end when it
  saw old data generated by the visual terminal application. The fix was to
  discard any data generated by the terminal front end when synchronizing the
  terminal view and not send it through to the back end.
