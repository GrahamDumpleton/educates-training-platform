Version 2.7.0
=============

Features Changed
----------------

* The version used for the local Kubernetes cluster has been updated to version
  1.27.

* Updated version of Miniconda used in Python workshop base image as the conda
  package resolver would fail to run when rebuilding the workshop base image
  using older version of Miniconda.

* Now set connect and server timeouts for Kubernetes REST API connections
  created by kopf based operators. This is to try and avoid reported problems of
  the operators not working on gke clusters when the number of nodes in the
  Kubernetes cluster is scaled up or down.
