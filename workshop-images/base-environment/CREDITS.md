The source code for the workshop base environment image initially borrowed code
from and was modelled after a similar project by the same author (Graham
Dumpleton) called [Homeroom](https://github.com/openshift-homeroom), which was
developed while working for Red Hat. The current source code for the workshop
base environment image is a major refactoring and rewrite of the prior work,
with a primary focus on native Kubernetes clusters instead of OpenShift. The
original workshop base environment image code was made available under the terms
of the Apache License, Version 2.0.
